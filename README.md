# Active-Learning-Using-various-representations

# This repository is for the active learning strategy implemented on various data representations in organic photovoltaics.

## Data description
The data is in 'Data' folder, which contains input features and output property Jsc

## Usage
- Run main.py by selecting different active learning algorithms
- There are 2 choices for getting input data: `get_input` for Active learning with known salient features, `get_input_all` for Active learning without known salient features
- After run main.py, all results will store in the folder: 'Results_Data' or 'Results_Plot'
## Analysis results
- The results are in the folder: 'Results_Data' or 'Results_Plot'

## Requirements for libraries
- numpy
- matplotlib
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- scipy
- pot
